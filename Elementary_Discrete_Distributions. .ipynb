    "# Review of Elementary Discrete Random Variables\n",

    "- Designed as supplementary material for CS237, Boston University\n",
    "- The purpose of this notebook is to introduce several of elementary discrete distributions. The reason we give such objects names, is because they arise naturally in a wide range of problems. When faced with such a problem, if we can argue that some random process fits one of these  formats, then we can simply quote properties we have derived already.  \n",
    "    - In particular, we need only determine what the values are that parameterize the distribution. \n",
    "- Random variables of this sort are called \"parametric\" random variables.\n",
    "- A useful way to think about this is to compare a Parametric distribution to a constructor in an abstract class. We provide an example below."

    "# Bernoulli\n",
    "We begin the discussion of distributions with one of the most elementary and important: the Bernoulli distribution.  Many problems in probability theory involve independently repeating random experiments and observing whether or not a specific event occurs. That is, Bernoulli random variables arise naturally in probability theory as indicators of events.  As a motivating example, suppose out of all possible outcomes $\\Omega$, we define $A\\subset \\Omega$ to be a success and $\\Omega \\setminus A$ to be a failure . Such an experiment is modeled by a random variable $X$ with Bernoulli distribution written $X\\sim Bernouli(p)$ with outcomes\n",
    " $$X= \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } A\\text{ occurs,}  \\\\\n",
    "0 & A \\text{ does not occur.}\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    " \\Pr[X=1]&=p\\\\\n",
    "  \\Pr[X=0]&=1-p\\\\\n",
    "  \\Pr[X=k]&=0 \\qquad \\forall k\\notin\\{0,1\\}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeated trials of a random experiment are called Bernoulli trials if the following conditions are met.\n",
    "- The trials are independent of each other.\n",
    "- The result of each trial is either a success or a failure\n",
    "- The probability of success remains unchanged from trial to trial\n",
    "\n",
    " Recall that independence of random variables $X,Y$ is defined as $$\\Pr[X|Y]=\\Pr[X]$$\n",
    "  and similarly, $$\\Pr[Y|X]=\\Pr[Y]$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Intuitively, this means that observing the outcome of one event in no way influences the outcome of future outcomes. For example, if I flip a fair coin 100 times and get all heads, I am still equally as likely to get heads or tails on the 101st flip. Each coin flip can be thought of as an independent Bernoulli trial with probability of success $p=1/2$.\n",
    "More generally, the most elementary example of a Bernoulli random variable, is flipping a $p$-biased coin, and having the random variable take on $1$ (success) if the coin comes up heads and $0$ (failure) otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that once we provide what the probability of success is, we know the pmf. I.E., the parameter for this distribution is $p$. \n",
    "Going back to the class constructor analogy, we can see that a Bernoulli Random Variable can indeed be represented as python class"
